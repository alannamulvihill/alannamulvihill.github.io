<p> This is my mom and dad, Magdalena and Tommy. Thank god for them
because they've always taken great care of me. My Mom is a teacher and my dad owns his own
contracting business. My mom graduated with a 4.0 GPA so I have alot to compete with.</p>

normal brother and sister but I love him so much and know I could trust him with
my life.</p>
